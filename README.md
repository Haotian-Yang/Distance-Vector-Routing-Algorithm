# Distance-vector Routing Algorithm
CSC358A3: Implementation of a distributed, asynchronous, distance-vector routing algorithm based on the Bellman-Ford algorithm 


## Sample 
```
python3 dvsim.py HasLinkChange Seed 
```
where HasLinkChange (1 or 0) specifies whether or not to add link-change events to the simulation, and Seed (an integer) is the seed of the pseudo-random number generator.
